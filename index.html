          Jiva Materials has created a flax-based printed circuit board ‚Äî
          Soluboard, which can be simply separated in hot water so the metals in
          electronic devices can be easily and safely extracted for new
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company‚Äôs solution has the potential to drastically improve the
          recyclability of all electronic products, reducing the need to mine
          rare minerals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Total funding = $1.9M. Imagine Jiva boards being in every phone and
          computer‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs impact.

            Turbine wants to understand cancer biology, and their simulation
            software can conduct all phases of cancer drug research much more
            efficiently. Thousands of molecular pairs can be effective drugs.
            The question is who can find the right composition. The essence of
            Turbine is to find the needle in the haystack.

        <p>
          You could resume Net zero through ‚Äúpeople, planet, profit‚Äù. The french
          startup just opened its 3rd facility in Brazil, where it uses coffee
          husks (biomass) to produce biochar:
          <strong
            >a proven carbon removal solution that could remove up to 2 billion
            tonnes of CO2 every year according to the IPCC.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          NetZero‚Äôs model focuses on local biochar production at an industrial
          scale, particularly effective in tropical regions. Where there is
          biochar‚Ä¶ carbon is sequestered for the long-term... soil quality and
          yields are increased... and the livelihoods of farmers are massively
          improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why them? Because NetZero's expansion demonstrates the replicability
          of its industrial model and its ability to connect stakeholders across
          the biochar value chain.
